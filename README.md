School projects are available upon request.

## Future Hometown Finder Project:
Created a web application that recommends towns/cities to live in based on criteria such as housing price, weather, crime rate, population density, and if there is a local hospital.
Cleaned and merged data from five different sources in a Python Jupyter Notebook. 
Created with Streamlit app framework and deployed with Heroku. 
Interacted with Google Custom Search API to display images of homes in recommended towns.
Link to application: https://future-hometown-finder.herokuapp.com/. Note that I have limited Google Custom Search API calls, so if you use the app only run it a few times (less than 10).

## Metallic Asteroid Classification:
Used 10-fold cross-validation and Imblearnâ€™s SMOTE oversampling to train and evaluate a classifier that attempts to identify asteroids with high metal content.
Compared several machine learning  models and achieved ~70% ROC AUC score and ~23% Precision-Recall AUC.

## Craigslist Used Automobile Regression:
Used Scikit-Learn to create a multiple linear regression and a random forest regression to predict the price of used vehicles.
Achieved an average accuracy of 78.28% relative to the actual listing prices and a mean absolute error of $1952.
